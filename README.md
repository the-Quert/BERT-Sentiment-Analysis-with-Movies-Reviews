# Sentiment Analysis with Movies Reviews 
#### This repo is a sentiment analysis classifier built with Transformer based models
- The whole experiment environment is tested and built on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
- This classifier is built with Transformer based models, LSTM and other NLP classifiers.


## Requirements     
- This project is allowed to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) with single GPU.      
If you prefer to work on local environment, this repo is able to run using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
- Since BERT model is developed under `Tensorflow 1.x`, more modification to get compatible with `Tensorflow 2.x` is already added to codes.

## Datasets
- [IMDB Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- [Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/overview)

## Run the classifier
To run the classifier, follow the instructions below...     
- If running on local environment, import [BERT_Demo](https://github.com/the-Quert/bert_demo/tree/master/bert_demo.ipynb) to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
- If running on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), import [BERT_Demo](https://github.com/the-Quert/bert_demo/tree/master/bert_demo.ipynb) directly.
